# BasicRoboticVacuumCleaner
My first AI project. A robot vacuum cleaner that cleans dirty tiles in a 2-D environment with random obstacles.

Robot allows to move up, down, left, right direction only.
Robot allows to move a tile per Action.
The environment is filled with randomized obstacles or impassable.
The robot will eventually clean all the tiles unless the given of number of steps are restricted or limited.
